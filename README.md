## Description

### 1 . Reproducing the results in the paper
    Inorder to reproduce the results in this paper just used the three arguments aling with the main file **run**
    
    superseding = True
    supersede_env : use the env you want (check below (1.1)
    supersede_buff : use the algo you want to run (see below (1.2) for available algorithms)
    
    
#### 1.1 Enviornments
    "Pendulum" : results in running the classic control pendulum env
    "Cartpole" : results in running the classic control cartpole env
    "Hopper"   : results in running the pybullet based roboschool hopper env
    "Walker2D" : results in running the pybullet based roboschool Walker2D env

#### 1.2 Algorithms
